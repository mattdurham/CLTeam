## Learning

This tries to only cover what is learned in the class and keep the code has lean and simple has possible. There are some bugs in the code. Some are mentioned, some are not. There are also some comments on how to improve it if you would like to fork the project and run it yourself.

It uses a simple json file for storage so is NOT suited for multi user or multiple commands.

Not all features are implements in the web ui, may get to those if I get some free time.

The web is trying to be has simple has possible but there are tons of things not covered in class there. Tried to add comments as appropriate.
